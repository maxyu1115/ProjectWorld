This is a World Destroying strategy game, where players aid Devi-Chan(邪神酱) in destroying humanity through invoking all kinds of disasters. 

It's not just simply wiping populations though; Devi-Chan's powers are derived from its cult. The more believers the more powerful, but it needs to sacrifice cultists to use spells, and cult members are killed by your spells just like normal people are. Players would want to balance growing the cult and unleashing Devi-Chan's wrath.
